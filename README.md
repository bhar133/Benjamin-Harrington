Personal Project: Tiger Pair

This is a website that I developed which is an app for finding study pairs.
It is designed so that people create their profile, and add classes, preferences, and other information needed.
After the profile is set up they can begin matching and searching for people they  think they would like to study with.
It is currently set up where you need to have a @lsu.edu email.
